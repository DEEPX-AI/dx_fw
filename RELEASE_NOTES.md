- None
### 2. Fixed
- Fix CPU reset logic
  - Added logic to disable D-cache and perform ISB (Instruction Synchronization Barrier) before CPU reset to address occasional reset failures.
- Fix throttling logic in user region (under 90'C)

## v1.6.3 / 2025-02-19
### 1. Changed
- Set LPDDR Frequency by User
    - Add features for setting LPDDR frequency by using $dxrt-cli-internal -t <target_freq>
    - Only Support [5200, 5400, 5600, 5800, 6000, 6200, 6400] Mbps for now
    - [Test]
        - Change LPDDR freq by using dxrt-cli-internal (with -t option)
    - [Related Issue]
        - None
### 2. Fixed
- Fixed Software Hang Issue
    - Fixed an issue where a software hang occurred when the device mode switched to power save mode during inference.
    - Modified the logic to transition to power save mode only if the bounding delete option is provided and no requests are received for 3 seconds.
    - [Test]
        - Performed inference using multiple processes.
        - Conducted inference on the entire ModelZoo.
    - [Related Issue]
        - Regression Fail
### 3. Added
- None


## v1.6.2 / 2025-02-12
### 1. Changed
- Print module revision version by gpio
- Update NPU Throttling driver
    - Emergency Stop (over 100'C): NPU inference will be paused until cool down (95'C)
    - NPU Throttling by Firmware (over 90'C): NPU frequency is managed by firmware
    - NPU Throttling by User (under 90'C): NPU frequency is mangaged by user (dxrt-cli -C)
- Implement QoS Driver
    - Improved the driver to measure DDR bandwidth for each NPU inference.
- Add Device Mode
    - Added device mode classification for power optimization.
    - Idle Mode: Mode where inference is in progress (NPU Clock On).
    - Power Save Mode: Standby state without inference (NPU Clock Off).
