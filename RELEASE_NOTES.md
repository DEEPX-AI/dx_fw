# RELEASE_NOTES

## v2.1.4 / 2025-09-04
### 1. Changed
- Update the version for compability
### 2. Fixed
- None
### 3. Added
- None

---

## v2.1.2 / 2025-07-18
### 1. Changed
- Implement stop & go inference function
  - The function has been modified to implement by splitting the tiles when the number of tiles is large.
  - The information is passed on from the model file and operates.
### 2. Fixed
- Fix qspi read logic which can cause underflow
### 3. Added
- Activate monitoring logic for weight data
  - The weight recovery concept of NPU is a separate mechanism.
  - That is, when NPU is damaged in weight, the device requests normal weight from the host through PCI.
  - The request and NPU operation can be performed simultaneously.

## v2.1.1 / 2025-07-07
### 1. Changed
### 2. Fixed
### 3. Added
- Added support for reading PCIe and DMA channel status via CLI command.
- Added message parser for RX eye measurement tool read/write feature.

- None
### 3. Added
- None

## v2.0.4 / 2025-05-12

### 2. Fixed
- Implement interrupt handler priority(5)
  - The taskENTER_CRITICAL API only disables interrupts with interrupt priorities higher than 5. There is a possibility of problems when using RTOS APIs on interrupts with interrupt priorities lower than 5. So we adjust the priorities for all interrupts.

    - [Related Issue]
        - None
### 2. Fixed

    - Fixed an issue where a software hang occurred when the device mode switched to power save mode during inference.
    - Modified the logic to transition to power save mode only if the bounding delete option is provided and no requests are received for 3 seconds.
    - [Test]
        - Performed inference using multiple processes.
